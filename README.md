This module is deprecated. For reference or potential bugfix releases use the [maintenance](https://github.com/apache/sling-org-apache-sling-commons-json/tree/maintenance) branch, which contains this module's code as it was just before deprecating it.

It is recommended to replace it uses with the `jakarta.json` library.
